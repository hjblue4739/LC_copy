'''
There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. 
You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. 
Derive the order of letters in this language.

Example 1: ["wrt",  "wrf",  "er", "ett",  "rftt"] ->  "wertf"
Example 2: ["z","x"] -> "zx"
Example 3: ["z","x","z"] -> ""
